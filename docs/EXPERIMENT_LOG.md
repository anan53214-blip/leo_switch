# LEO_switch Experiment Log

This file records experiment results, diagnosis, and code changes that affect
training or evaluation behavior. Add a new entry for every experiment run,
including failed or inconclusive runs.

## Recording Checklist

- Experiment directory and command
- Code version or short description of local changes
- Objective, selection metric, seed, timesteps, episodes, max steps, user count
- Main comparison table: reward, effective latency score, delay, continuity,
  task success, deadline violation, energy
- Reward component diagnosis: delay, energy, QoS, continuity, handover,
  enqueue, deadline, queue-full, failed-handover, handover-cost
- Interpretation: what improved, what regressed, and likely root cause
- Follow-up decision: keep, revert, tune, or rerun

## 2026-05-10 01:07:57 - Baseline Compare, Latency Priority

**Experiment directory:** `results/baseline_compare/20260510_010757`

**Command summary:** `scripts/compare_system_baselines.py --run-mode train_compare --objective multi_objective --total-timesteps 1200000 --episodes 10 --max-steps 2000 --seed 42 --num-users 20 --best-model-metric effective_latency_score --compare-ranking-metric effective_latency_score --baselines all`

**Code state:** pre-fix reward and training defaults. Reward did not include an
explicit service-continuity term. MAPPO entropy coefficient used a hard-coded
linear decay to 10% by about 600k steps. Training CLI defaulted to
`n_epochs=4`, `batch_size=256`.

**Main result:**

| Method | Mean Reward | Effective Latency | Avg Delay | Continuity | Task Success | Deadline Violation | Energy / Resolved Task |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MADDPG | 952.221 | 0.297095 | 2.113535 | 0.988585 | 0.935667 | 0.064211 | 2.073609 |
| Min-Distance | 951.742 | 0.296882 | 2.113866 | 0.987993 | 0.935659 | 0.064219 | 2.073682 |
| DQN | 907.117 | 0.279776 | 2.186189 | 0.974788 | 0.914433 | 0.085330 | 1.702983 |
| HAN+MAPPO | 795.113 | 0.273059 | 2.218435 | 0.987705 | 0.889758 | 0.110106 | 1.194593 |
| MAPPO (no HAN) | 792.147 | 0.272036 | 2.233144 | 0.988277 | 0.889959 | 0.109919 | 1.245349 |

**Diagnosis:**

HAN+MAPPO was energy-efficient but lost on task success and deadline
violations. The earlier suspicion that service continuity was around 0.488 was
incorrect; that value was load-balance score. Evaluation continuity was already
high at 0.987705. The reward/metric mismatch still matters because
`effective_latency_score = 1 / (1 + delay) * continuity * task_success`, while
the reward optimized additive delay, energy, QoS, handover, and load-balance
terms.

Training curves showed exploration collapse after about 600k steps and weak
handover success improvement. HAN provided almost no measured gain over MAPPO
without HAN in this run.

**Code changes started from this diagnosis on 2026-05-12:**

- Added step-level `reward_service_continuity` to align reward with the
  continuity factor used by `effective_latency_score`.
- Lowered default `reward_failed_handover_penalty` from 0.6 to 0.3.
- Changed training defaults to `n_epochs=10`, `batch_size=64`,
  `entropy_coef=0.005`, and `entropy_schedule=constant`.
- Added configurable MAPPO entropy schedules: `constant` and `linear`.
- Added reward breakdown fields to baseline comparison summaries and
  per-episode CSV output.

**Follow-up experiment:**

Rerun the same suite with a new output directory and compare reward components
for every method, not only HAN+MAPPO training history. Primary success criteria:
HAN+MAPPO should improve `task_success_rate`, lower `deadline_violation_rate`,
and raise `effective_latency_score` without destroying energy efficiency.
